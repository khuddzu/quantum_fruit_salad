This repository is a current work in progess. More code snippets will be added after my defense and as projects become public. 

This repository will serve as an archival collection of code from my PhD candidacy. 

While some of the code may be highly tailored to specific research tasks, this repository showcases the evolution of my coding skills, problem-solving abilities, and the breadth of technologies I've encountered, navigating the world of scientific computing and data analysis.

Feel free to explore this code archive to gain insights into my coding style, methodologies, and the challenges I've tackled throughout my academic pursuits. If you find any code snippets or projects of interest, I welcome collaboration, discussion, and potential further development.

Please note, most contents shared here will act as artifacts, and their relevance may vary.
