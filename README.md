This repository serves as an archival collection of code artifacts from my graduate student journey, encompassing a diverse range of projects and experiments. From computational chemistry scripts to machine learning prototypes and data analysis utilities, it houses the culmination of my coding endeavors during this period.

While some of the code may be highly specialized and tailored to specific research tasks, this repository showcases the evolution of my coding skills, problem-solving abilities, and the breadth of technologies I've encountered. It reflects the journey of a graduate student navigating the intricate world of scientific computing and data analysis.

Feel free to explore this code archive to gain insights into my coding style, methodologies, and the challenges I've tackled throughout my academic pursuits. If you find any code snippets or projects of interest, I welcome collaboration, discussion, and potential further development.

Please note that the contents here are historical artifacts, and their relevance may vary. For my latest work and professional projects, kindly refer to my more specialized repositories.
