The purpose of this repository is to act as an archival collection of code artifacts from my graduate student career. It shall encompass a diverse range of projects and tests. 
While some of the code may be specialized and tailored to specific research tasks, this repository will showcase the evolution of my coding skills and problem-solving abilities, as well as display different softwares I've encountered.

Feel free to explore this code archive to gain insights into my coding style, methodologies, and the challenges I've tackled throughout my academic pursuits. If you find any code snippets or projects of interest, I welcome collaboration and discussion.

Please note that the contents here are historical artifacts, and their relevance may vary. For my latest work and professional projects, please refer to more specialized repositories to which I have contributed. 

** At this point in time this repository is still a work-in-progress. I will continue to add to it as time permits, as well as when more of my work becomes available to the public, as some code can not yet be shared as it is still in the pre-print stage. 

## Installation and Formatting:

Some code within this repository is installable, as my original function of this repo was not to have it work as an archive. However, most code snippets are archival. All installable code is within the quantum\_fruit\_salad directory. 

### To Install:

`git clone git@github.com:khuddzu/quantum_fruit_salad.git`

`pip install -e .`
